1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
RTO is the time to complete the switch to a standby replica in another AZ. 60 to 120 seconds.
See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html#Concepts.MultiAZ.Failover.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
RTO is the time to promote the read replica instance in the standby region to be the new master and
then route the traffic to the new endpoint (manual). 45 minutes to 1 hour.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
RPO is minimum as the database fails over to the hot standby instance which has been kept up to date synchronously. Near zero.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
RPO is the amount of time between the system being taken offline and the last backup.
It depends on a frequency of the backups and the speed to restore them. RDS takes transaction log backups every 5 minutes.
RPO will be determined also in the time it takes to promote the read replica (human). 30 minutes to hours.
